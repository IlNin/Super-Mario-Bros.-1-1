# Super-Mario-Bros.-1-1
The first level of Super Mario Bros. recreated with GameMaker.


<b>Features:</b><br/>
Relive this classic by playing a recreated (and working-in-progress) version of the first level of Super Mario Bros. developed using GameMaker, that uses many of the sprites, animations, sound effects and music that you remember.


<b>Comments:</b><br/>
Even though it's still working-in-progress after all these years, this is still my dream project and hopefully one day I will get to complete it. The game is perfectly playable and the level is actually beatable, but there's still a ton of features, such as power-ups, that I still need to implement. I also need to improve the physics system since Mario can't currently reach the top of the flag when finishing the level: for now, let's pretend he ate a little too much! :D


<b>Install Instructions:</b><br/>
Import this project in GameMaker and build/execute it there.
